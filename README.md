#The Mueller Report NLP#

Using Spacy from <https://spacy.io>
Take the searchable report from CNN <https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/04/18/mueller-report-searchable.pdf>
Write a quick script and see the output

##Caveats##
Nothing in life is simple, given the size of the report you have to 
decide how to read it in chunks. I select byte size chunks vs say paragraphs. 
It's possible / probable that something will get missed but given the scanned quality of the document you've got other issues to worry about.
